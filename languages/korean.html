        <h3>Project Aim</h3>
        <p>
            As Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spreads throughout the world, most countries are strongly encouraging folks to begin social distancing and don't make any unnecessary trips.
        </p><p>
            COVID-19 is especially dangerous for older folks (50+) and immunocompromised individuals.
        
            Elderly Asian individuals are arguably the most affected by this. Not only do they face discrimination, they also have barriers of accessibility, mobility, and language.
        </p><p>
            The goal of this project is to provide support for these people by delivering groceries or running errands, minimizing the contact they have with the outside.
