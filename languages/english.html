<h3>Support Request </h3>
<p>
    As Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spreads throughout the world, most countries are strongly encouraging folks to begin social distancing and don't make any unnecessary trips.

    COVID-19 is especially dangerous for older folks (50+) and immunocompromised individuals.
    
    Elderly Asian individuals are arguably the most affected by this. Not only do they face discrimination, they also have barriers of accessibility, mobility, and language.
    
    The goal of this project is to provide support for these people by delivering groceries or running errands, minimizing the contact they have with the outside.
    
    Before filling out the form, please ensure you match at least one of the following requirements:
    
    1) 50 years of age or older; OR
    2) Immunocompromised; OR
    3) Disabled
